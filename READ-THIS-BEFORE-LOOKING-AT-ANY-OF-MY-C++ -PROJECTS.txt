These are the C++ projects that I have worked on. For each project there is a .cpp, and maybe a .exe executable file. NOTE: All projects won't have .exe files, and if there is a .exe file then it will be the same name as the .cpp file.
Also, if you want to see what these programs can do, copy the code and then paste the code into GDB Online Debugger, or any other compiler and runner. If you are using GDB Online, then delete the template code, then copy my code in.
